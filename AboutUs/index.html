              <h3>Meet my puppy,  Max</h3>
              <p>
                I was going through a rough time when Max came home. I didn't say it out loud, but I was really struggling. I didn't tell my parents how bad things felt when I asked for Max, I just said I wanted a dog. I didn't say I felt like I was barely holding it together. I didn't want them to worry. <br><br>
                But the truth is, I needed something to hold onto, and Max became that something. This tiny, clumsy Rottweiler walked in like he owned the place… and somehow, my heart too. <br><br><br><br>
                He didn't fix everything, but he brought peace into places I didn't even know were loud. He gave me something to care for, something to wake up for, and a kind of love that expected nothing except to be loved back. <br><br>
                Watching him grow up and trust me with his whole world changed something in me. It inspired me to create this space for all the other pets who are just as ready to trust someone with everything they've got. <br><br>

          <h2>Fighting a Broken System</h2>
          <p>
            In Kosovo, stray animals are often reduced to numbers or ignored completely. There's a government program that offers ~€50 for vaccinating them, but too often that's where the care stops. The money is taken, and the animal is left behind. No warmth, no home, no promise.
            PawPromise was born out of frustration with that system, and out of love for the animals caught in it. These pets aren't an inconvenience. They're trust wrapped in a body that needs someone to speak up for it.

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            At PawPromise, we're not just offering help — we're offering hope. Our mission is to connect stray animals with real, loving homes. To give them more than food and medicine. To give them family.
            Because somewhere out there, there's a lot of strays like Max waiting to be found and given a chance, to love and to trust.
